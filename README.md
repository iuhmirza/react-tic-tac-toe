# react-tic-tac-toe

I should state from the outset that the accomplishment here isn't the project itself, but the completion of the tutorial at `reactjs.org`. It covers a significant amount of material in a concise manner through a single project.

JSX appears to be an elegant way to describe the UI. I found the concept of lifting state up to be the most challenging. This is likely due to my lack of experience with state management.

I plan to come back to this tutorial several times, until I understand it fully.
